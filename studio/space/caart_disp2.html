His answer was "Yes of course" and again, I was excited to add another piece of denim to my collection of 7. Hey, you can never have enough denim in your closet!',
'"Hey Herin, I got this for you." One of the warmest winter scarves I\'ve gotten as a present from my really good friend. A winter in New York is no good without a thick scarf like this.',
'Chilling at home wearing this sweater with my PJ\'s, pairing this sweater with my blue collared shirt.',
'I remember when I first discovered this sweater in my mom\'s closet, I was so excited that I found it. It was super cute and I already imagined myself wearing it around. I\'m a huge fan of vintage things so I was super happy to be able to own this piece of clothing.',
'Something I bought with my own money that I am proud of. I remember getting this on sale for $10 thinking it was such a good buy, and it was. Gap jeans can never be this cheap. Sales on top of sales. I love the fit of these jeans.',

'Bought this scarf when I was obsessed with scarves and had a scarf collection in high school.',
'My favorite sweater that I own at the moment. First time I wore it, my friend wore it on the same day.'
